## Based on your work in this project, document your findings and present how a feature store would be useful.

Model prep such as feature engineering is the most time consuming part of most data projects. The feature store is meant to consolidate this.


I can certainly see the time-saving benefits. Especially now as MLOps and AI-embedded BI are becoming popular, something like a feature store can similarly work to democratize and lower turnaround time of data products. 


However like any technology project there would be implementation costs and risks. In particular, if the underlying relationships of the data change (such as they might have done during the pandemic), I'd be interested to know how a feature store would compare to other approaches in mitigating this model degradation.
